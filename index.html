                        As an outsider, Aoi's actions are under constant scrutiny. However, her respectful behavior and good manners soon had locals observing her out of curiosity instead. It is rumored that, after defending a village from a group of bandits, she refused the reward offered by the villagers, and only took a few foodstuffs. While her intentions remain a mystery, many have speculated that she is looking for a worthy leader to serve.

Faced with danger on all sides, Gargantor quickly learned the value of loyalty. Gargantor chose to wield a shield, to symbolize his determination to defend Anthropos. In the hands of Gargantor, the shield was a deadly weapon. His unique combat style and iron will allowed him to quell the rebellion, expel invaders, and secure the throne. After witnessing him in action, many took to calling him "Metal King".”

                        Most would agree that Reginald led a "charmed life". Born into the royal family of Kingsdor, Reginald enjoyed a peaceful childhood a lavish castle. He read about wars that were fought before he was born, and studied under the best tutors in the country. Reginald's life was turned upside down when the king died. His family not only refused to acknowledge him as heir to the throne, but also accused him of killing his own father. When the scandalous news spread to the public, it sparked anger and unrest. With Kingsdor entering into an era of political strife and unrest, Reginald must show that he is the rightful heir of Kingsdor!77

                        ”Known as "The Beastkin that slew death", Skullrock is a legendary figure in Vollandia, rumored to be invincible.Skullrock had always claimed that fighting was the one thing that made him feel alive. It was said that he died of exhaustion fighting over a thousand elves by himself, his body no longer able to keep up with his desire for blood.By some dark magic, Skullrock was resurrected. As he qot up from the blood-soaked ground, only thoughts of battle filled his mind.Every once in a while, images of life pierce through the red mist in his mind. Memories that were once dismissed as mundane and insipid now cause great confusion. Has life alwavs been more than battle?”

                        “Once upon a time, the elves controlled a vast empire that spanned the continent. The elves lived in luxury, drawing all their energy from the Eternal Crystal, a boundless well of power. But an unfortunate accident shattered the Eternal Crystal, resulting in a bitter civil war. The elves splintered into two tribes, the Sunsinger warriors and the Moonseeker mages. The Sunsingers trained Blademasters to counter the powerful mages. Elves like Valenia, who were very sensitive to magic, were recruited from young and schooled in anti-magic arts. After a lifetime of indoctrination, Valenia firmly believed that all mages were evil, and had to be put down like the dangerous animals they were.”
